/**
 * Protection of the conductor from the vibration induced by wind (STN EN 50341-1, cl. 9.2.4/SK.2)
 * Need to be calculated for EVERY SPAN in the suspension section.
 * 
 * Firstly the horizontal load from state equation needs to be calculated with parameters:
 * theta_0 = T_x,0 
 * theta_1 = T_X,p 
 * t_p = 1y = 8760h
 * T_x = -5 degreeC
